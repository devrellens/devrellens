### The problem

- It takes a loooooong time to go thru due dillegence process.
- It is hard to recognize or judge techie candidates for devrels without technical backgrounds.
- It takes a endless time and energy to keep track on the grantees and monitor financial status.

### Solutions

- Key features: Quest + Lens + Whitelist
    - Quest: grantee candidates fill out the quests and the score will be counted as one metric that judges sincerity or knowledge on that track
    - Lens: the number of lens friens will be also counted as that grantee’s social credibility
    - Whitelist: Once a candidate get a chance to come across/have a meeting with devrel, he/she can be added to that devrel’s whitelist
